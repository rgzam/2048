# 2048 Clone Game
Welcome to our 2048 clone game project! This game is a terminal-based implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle, and we have exciting plans to enhance it with a graphical user interface in the later stages of development.
## how to play
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- Tiles with the same value will merge when moved into each other.
- The goal is to reach the 2048 tile by merging smaller tiles.
