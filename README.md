# 2048 Clone Game
Welcome to our 2048 clone game project! This game is a haskell GUI version of the popular 2048 puzzle. The game allows players to choose from different difficulty levels (Beginner, Normal, and Hard) and aims to reach the tile with a value of 2048.
## How to Play
- Run the Haskell program, and the game will start with a difficulty menu.
- Use the keys '1', '2', or '3' to choose between Beginner, Normal, or Hard difficulty levels, respectively.
## how to play
- Use the arrow keys ('Up', 'Down', 'Left', 'Right') to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- Press 'R' to restart the game.
- Press 'M' to return to the difficulty menu at any time.
## Game Rules 
- Tiles with the same value merge when moved into each other.
- The game ends when there are no more possible moves or when a tile with a value of 2048 is reached.
## Dependencies
- The game is implemented in Haskell and relies on the Gloss library for graphics.
